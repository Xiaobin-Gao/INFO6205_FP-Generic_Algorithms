### Topic: Genetic Algorithms For Image
  Give a picture with color white and black and return a picture that look like the orignal one.
###Implement
  Search the whole picture and get the black points to be the target.
  To make it simple, we just compress the picture and get less point for excuting quicker.
  Generate 1000 random set of points as first generation.
  Calculate the total distance between one set and target points.
  Use the
